      <p class="description">This article is a writeup narrative of a partnership between my then employer and a smart laundry startup. I conducted an interview with the startup's founder in order to craft the story we wanted to tell and published it on my employer's LinkedIn page.</p>
      <p>Tumble's machines are next gen and immediately caught the eye of our Director of Innovations, Dave - not only would Tumble's technology enable cashless payments, it would also come with predictive maintenance, machine reservations, and a
        remote locking mechanism. In just a few days, we set up a call with Tumble's founder, Scott Patterson, to get to know his story, the company, and most importantly, Tumble's technology. Suffice it to say, we loved the product.
        <br>Over the next few weeks, we set to find a few select properties across the Prime portfolio to pilot Tumble's technology on our common area laundry machines, quickly identifying <span class="grey">[redacted – property name]</span> as a
        primary candidate. The installation went underway in a breeze, with Scott personally visiting the property, greeting the building's resident manager as they walked through the laundry facilities together to gauge whether Tumble's machines would
        be a good fit. And thankfully, it was the ideal test bed.
        <br>Tumble's technology is built on SpeedQueen laundry machines. We removed our then-installed washing machines and replaced them with Tumble's SpeedQueens, placing flyers in the laundry room to inform residents, letting them know of the
        new technology and how to use it, including the Tumble app. We started seeing results as soon as the machines were installed. Residents loved Tumble's machines, touting its convenience and ease of use. It is not an exaggeration to say that the
        <span class="grey">[redacted – property name]</span> pilot with Tumble was a huge success.
        <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Growing Together</span>
        <br class="no-space">With this new achievement unlocked, the Veritas Innovations team initially sought out our RPMs to see whether they would be interested in replacing their building's common area laundry machines with Tumble's innovative technology. As
        expected, the responses were enthusiastic, already having several properties in their portfolios in mind that would greatly benefit from an upgraded laundry room experience. After that, it was only a matter of making sure Tumble's machines
        would fit, getting them installed, and notifying residents of this new and improved amenity.
        <br>In its very early stages, Scott failed to garner significant interest in Tumble, including from mom & pop and corporate property manager firms; only emails expressing concerns of the technology's viability came back. Either that, or
        Scott never received a response. All he needed was for someone to be willing to place Tumble machines in their laundry rooms. If worse came to worse, Tumble would simply deactivate their technology and leave behind the underived SpeedQueen.
        <br>Veritas Innovations, who truly value implementing inventive solutions to enhance the resident experience, was the first party to reach back out to learn more about Tumble's technology. And just as we introduced the Tumble team to our
        GreenTree property managers, so did we connect them to our extensive network of real estate professionals across the country, propelling the laundry startup to new heights.
