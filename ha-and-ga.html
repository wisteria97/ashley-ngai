      <p class="description">The following is a coprywriting exercise of an email informing users of a Japanese learning website of an article that describes the differences between 2 subject markers.</p>
      <p><span class="underline">Subject</span>: The は vs. が Debate
        <br>Whether you’ve been learning Japanese for months or even years, we’ve all come across this question at some point: do I use は or が?
        <br>Maybe you’ve heard that the particle you use changes the focus of the sentence. Or maybe you read that it doesn’t really matter which one you use, even Japanese people can’t tell the difference. Or better yet, maybe you read a dissertation explaining the nuances that は and が give to the sentence as a whole. Whatever you’ve heard or read, knowing the difference between the two particles will definitely take you to that next step into advancing your understanding of Japanese.
        <br>Don’t know where to start? Luckily, <a class="blue-link" href="https://www.tofugu.com/about/people/jenny-stainton/">Jenny</a> has it all laid out for you in <a class="blue-link" href="https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/wa-and-ga/">は and が: What’s the Difference Between These Japanese Particles, Really?</a>
        <br>And here are only a few examples on why your Japanese abilities and understanding of the language will only improve after reading this deep-dive:
      </p>
        <ol>
          <li>The real meanings behind は and が and what roles they play in a sentence</li>
          <li>How to use は and が to create emphasis</li>
          <li>Why sometimes, は and が aren’t even necessary</li>
          <li>And when other times, は and が are used in the same sentence</li>
        </ol>
      <p>
        But what about stories and practice examples? Jenny’s got you covered!
        <br>For the nitty-gritty details, you know what to do: read it now or bookmark it for later.
