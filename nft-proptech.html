      <p class="description">This article describes the role of NFTs in the art community and its potential uses in the real estate industry as a form of tokenized ownership of assets.</p>
      <p>
        <br>If you’ve been following the developments surrounding NFTs, its role in accelerating climate change most likely hasn’t escaped you, either. NFTs emit a far larger carbon footprint than you can imagine, because it is typically stored and maintained on an Ethereum network, which utilizes a system that consumes extremely large amounts of energy. NFTs have only been around for a few years, so there are few peer-reviewed studies on its environmental impact. But those that do exist on cryptocurrency, especially Bitcoin, make the future of NFT’s look grim.
        <br>The problem is the system that maintains the integrity of the data, which has been found to <a class="blue-link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/feb/27/bitcoin-mining-electricity-use-environmental-impact">consume more energy than entire countries</a>. In fact, <a class="blue-link" href="https://memoakten.medium.com/the-unreasonable-ecological-cost-of-cryptoart-2221d3eb2053">a single transaction of Ethereum consumes on average 35 kilowatts</a>, or the equivalent of what an EU resident would consume in 4 days. And that’s just Ethereum.
        <br>What do you think the average was found to be for NFTs? According to Memo Akten, a computational engineer who analyzed energy consumption of tens of thousands of NFT transactions, that number more than doubled to 82 kWh. This happens because of its Proof of Work system, a <a class="blue-link" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consensus-mechanism-cryptocurrency.asp#:~:text=A%20consensus%20mechanism%20is%20a,systems%2C%20such%20as%20with%20cryptocurrencies.">consensus mechanism</a> that enables people to mine blocks to add to their network. The more work that is put into the system, the more you are rewarded for your efforts, which spurs people to invest in powerful computers that can solve those complex puzzles and therefore consume tons of electricity.
        <br>But there’s good news. Akten’s study analyzed NFTs only on the Ethereum blockchain, which currently uses the PoW system. But NFTs are also traded on non-PoW systems, called Proof of Stake, or PoS, which relies on validators rather than miners. Basically, users put a stake in the system to add new blocks, rather than mine them, which is why blockchain networks using PoS systems emit virtually zero carbon emissions.
        <br>Because of NFTs’ environmental impact, many people involved with trading NFTs have taken actions to make up for the energy used, such as offsetting their impact (i.e. donating to sustainability projects), using renewable energy to power their machines, developing low-carbon NFTs, or using a non-Ethereum blockchain network like Tezos, which uses a PoS system.
        <br>So what if real estate, one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases, became open to and started implementing NFTs as a means of trading fractionalized assets? As developers, investors, and property managers move toward a net-zero goal, it seems counterintuitive to invest in NFTs given current research. While offsetting the impact NFTs have on the environment may be a quick and easy solution, it could also potentially cost hundreds of thousands of dollars even for one token. On the bright side, it’s fortunate that Ethereum, where NFTs are most prevalent, plans to <a class="blue-link" href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/">move their consensus mechanism to a PoS</a> in order to improve their energy efficiency.
